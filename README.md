**Splat3GearView** connects to a Nintendo Switch console running sys-botbase and reads all the gear data directly from RAM. Gear can then be viewed directly in the tool, or dumped to a JSON format compatible with https://leanny.github.io/splat3seedchecker/#/settings, making it easier to get your desired sub abilities.

I believe this piece of software to be risk-free as it only reads from RAM and never writes to it, but **I do not take any responsibility for any bans or damages** that may come as a result of using it. Be sensible!

## Planned Features
*No real timeframe for these*
* **Images** of the gear + ability icons
* **RNG Prediction**
